# Tezos Onboarding

I trying this Node JS project to figure out how the Tezos ecosystem works

# Informations available

With this repo, I want to validate how the Tezos works, so for any "_.js" files you can run it like "node _.js"

# Roadmap

- [x] Connect to the Tezos Baker and query the balance
- [x] Create and import a Tezos Account to DataHub
- [x] Query Tezos blockchain
- [ ] Inject operation on Tezos node
